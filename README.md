# video-sharing-app
Kind of a social network thingy. Main idea is to allow the user to upload videos/images along with a desired text content that will be shown in his profile and in other users feeds if they follow him. He also will be able to upload a profile picture that can be updated later on. Hoping to also add a private live chat between users, being able to interact with other users posts be it either via leaving a comment or liking it.
